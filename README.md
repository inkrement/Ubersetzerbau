## Compilerbau

This repository contains my solutions of the course 'Ãœbersetzerbau' at the UT Vienna (SS14). Some parts are more or less buggy, but it was enough to pass the course without problems. Special thanks to @DomPich for some tricky bugfixes.

Make was used as default buildtool and we had to work with flex, bison, iburg and other related tools. Sorry for the bad coding style, but I had not enough time to make it properly.
